\section{Initial Analysis}
\subsection{Sample matrix}
I performed some initial analysis on the sample interaction data present at \url{http://www.eurexpress.org/ee/tools/EurExpressCluster_01.zip}.
At first, I tested whether there are certain classes of genes those are expressed in different anatomy ( those are significantly more than expected, like the housekeeping genes analysis similar to \cite{eisenberg2003human}). Figures ~\ref{fig:strongHist} , \ref{fig:mildlyHist} and \ref{fig:weaklyHist} respectively shows the histogram of strongly expressed, mildly expressed ( genes those are highly or mildly expressed) and weakly expressed genes ( highly, mildly or weakly expressed).  
I have also overlay corresponding null distribution for each of the cases. I assumed binomial distribution with mean equal to observed mean as the null distribution. 
As seen from the figure the class genes are significantly compared to null distribution, particular in (1) classes where a gene is expressed in fewer number of anatomies (Probably this is not very interesting). (2) classes where a gene is expressed many tissues.

	\label{fig:strongHist}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{midlyExpressed.jpg}
	\end{center}
	\caption{mildly expressed gene histogram}
	\label{fig:mildlyHist}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{weaklyExpressed.jpg}
	\end{center}
	\caption{weakly expressed gene histogram}
	\label{fig:weaklyHist}
\end{figure}

Next, I performed some annotation analysis whether these over represented genes are enriched in any particular annotation. I further divided the genes which are strongly expressed in many anatomies (and occur more than expected by null distribution P-value $<$ E-8) into following groups:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Strong40: The genes which are strongly expressed in more than 40 anatomy are enriched in membrane
		related annotation. The annotation have two prominent clusters: one with membrane and trans-membrane function; other with bi-sulfide  related functions.
	\item  Stong20: The genes which are strongly expressed in more than 20 anatomy are enriched in homestatis, adhesion and DNA repair functions,
		in addition to membrane and bi-sulfide functions.
	\item  Strong8: The genes which are strongly expressed in more than 8 anatomy are enriched in growth factor activity, glycoprotien and muscle 
		development
		in addition to functionalities of strong40 and strong20.
\end{itemize}


It seems the genes, which are strongly expressed across many anatomies, are enriched in house-keeping functions (note I have reported only those annotation clusters which
are significantly compared to all mouse genes as background). 


\subsection{Interaction matrix 5510x811}

I performed analysis similar to performed on the sample matrix. At first, I compared the distributions of number of tissue types in which gene
expressed with its null distribution. The null distribution assumed to be binomial distribution ( with $n = 811$ and $p = \frac{  \textit{non-zero entries in interaction matrix}}{\textit{total size of interaction matrix}}$). I performed 3 separate analysis 1.  Strong expression only (figure \ref{fig:strongEx}), 2. Medium or strong expression (figure \ref{fig:mediumEx})and 3. Weak, medium or strong expression (figure \ref{fig:weakEx}).

\subsection{Unsupervised clustering and visualization}

The complete matrix is shown in 
figure ~/ref{fig:intM}. Since the matrix is sparse, any structure is not discernible. 
In order to find any prominent structure in the interaction matrix. I performed unsupervised clustering by two method: 1. Principal component
analysis (figure ~\ref{fig:intMPCG}, ~\ref{fig:intMPCA}) 2. Hierarchical clustering (figure ~/ref{fig:intMHierarchical}).
