\section{Results}
\subsection{Summary}
In this study, we performed biclustering of in-situ hybridization of mouse embryo. We obtained 50 biclusters. 
In this main paper we will give the analysis with respect to first five biclusters.
The biclusters obtained were consistent across random initialization.
The bicluster of tissue matches closely with the tissue tree. We performed GO enrichment analysis and motif enrichment analysis of the biclusters. The
biclusters have clear epigenetic signatur, indicating tissue specific regulation. Finally, we performed disease association studies of tissue biclusters.

In order to compare the quality of ISH expression matrix we performed all the analysis on Novartis dataset, in addition to ISH dataset. Novartis
dataset composed of expression of 36,182 transcript across 61 mouse tissues. 

\subsection{Consistency of biclusters}
We used ns-NMF followed by metaclustering to obtain biclusters of the expression matrices. 
To check the biclusters obtained were consistent we used different random initialization of NMF algorithm. Figure 1. shows the pairwise distance of 
bicluster. Two bicluster were considered to be similar when 75\% genes in bicluster are same. The distance represent similar bicluster across differ 
in number of genes. In summary, the biclusters across different runs was consistent.

In summary, the result indicates that the biclusters obtained by the biclustering
algorithm are not only statistically significant but also are biologically relevant. In the rest of the section, we will study these biological 
interpretations of the biclusters in rest of the section. 


\subsection{Tissue specificity}
Table \ref{tab:tissue} the tissue tree corresponding to the first 10 biclusters. Tissue type of Cluster 1 are related to neural system, in particular
tissue that are effected during the neurulation of embryo. Pons located in brain stem relay signal between forebrain and cerebellum. Basal, marginal, mantle and basal corresponds to motor area of spinal cord.
Tissue types of Cluster 3 are respiratory system related.
Tissue types of Cluster 4 mixture of primary skin and nervous system related tissues.
Tissue types of Cluster 5 are mixture of many primary tissues.
Tissue types of Cluster 6 are carnial nerves related part of body part and function; 
trigeminal related to face,
vagus is for body state, accessory are muscle related and vestibular nerve is for spatial orientation of 
the body.
\missingfigure{Comparison of the bicluster with tissue tree}
Figure 2 shows the comparison of biclusters with the tissue tree of E14.5 of mouse. The biclusters are
broadly in agreement with the tissue tree indicating that the gene expression 
are predictive of the cellular identity.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{ISH annotation matrix}
We obtained the annotation of 5,600 MGI transcripts across 811 anatomical structure (ISH matrix) of mice 
embryo from Eurexpress consortium. The consortium had manually annotated into (strong, medium, weak and no) 
expression levels across each anatomical structure of the transcripts using RNA ISH on frozen sagittal 
sections of wild type mice at E14.5 \cite{Diez-Roux2011a}. 

\subsection{Biclustering}
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) biclustering methods involves two steps: 1) factorization of original matrix into two
matrices that leads to dimensionality
reduction of the original data and 2) clustering of the reduced dimension factor matrices (meta-clustering). 
ns-NMF is the method used for matrix decomposition (and dimensionality reduction)
of the ISH matrix followed by clustering of the factor matrices proposed by Badea et. al. \cite{badea2007stable}.

\textbf{Decomposition}: ns-NMF is method that factorize a matrix $V \in R^{m\times n}$ into matrices
$W\in R^{m\times k}$ and $H \in R^{k \times n}$ with the reduced dimensions as follows:
\begin{equation}
    V \approx WSH,
\end{equation}

Where $S$ is a smoothing matrix, that induces the sparseness condition on $W$ and $H$ matrix.
NMF methods allow only additive operation during the decomposition and therefore $W$ and $H$ are non negative,
this is a distinguishing aspect of NMF from other dimensionality reduction methods such as
principal component analysis (PCA). We used this version of NMF on the ISH matrix
to obtain respective $W$ and $H$ by using the algorithm defined by \cite{carmona2006biclustering}.  

\textbf{Metaclustering}: The metaclustering approach of \cite{badea2007stable} was used to 
find bicluster from $W$ and $H$.
The approach gives a non-overlapping set of biclusters. The biclustering algorithm was ran multiple times with random
initialization to obtain a consistent
set of stable biclusters. To speed up the biclustering algorithm across multiple run, biclusters were run on multiple 
cores using the doMC and Foreach package of R. 


\subsection{GO annotation analysis}
A standard hypergeometric GO enrichment of each bicluster was performed using the GOstat package in R for each  MF,
BP and CC GO-terms separately. 
Since GO terms are not independent of each other, the 
GO graph was used to estimate the over-representation \cite{alexa2006improved}. We used two
criteria to estimate the quality of biclustering algorithm: a) fraction of biclusters that have at-least one 
GO term enriched and b) total number of GO terms enriched in the biclusters.


Various parameters of the biclustering algorithm are chosen so as to obtain 
best value of the GO enrichment metric in the biclusters. 

\subsection{Epigenetic enrichment analysis of biclusters}
The epigenetic data were collected from the various sources including 1) Cistrome (http://cistrome.org), 2) ENCODE (http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/)and 3) UW-ENCODE (http://www.uwencode.org/).  Gene set enrichment analysis using the 
promoter ( 1 Kb upstream 100bp downstream of TSS)
of the gene set in each bicluster was done using overlap analysis followed by Fisher's exact test in R.

\subsection{Motif enrichment analysis}
The promoters of the gene set in each bicluster were scanned 
for binding sites of each of  981 vertebrate motifs in TRANSSFAC using \cite{hannenhalli2008eukaryotic}.
The score
that was 95\% percentile of that motif of the maximum score possible was considered to be true binding site. The
enrichment analysis was performed using the binding sites in promoter of one bicluster against all promoter in 
the biclusters using the Fisher's exact test. GC composition was controlled by sampling prior to motif enrichment 
analysis.
